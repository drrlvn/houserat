# üêÄ Houserat

A daemon that monitors network traffic for DHCP and ARP packets from known devices and sends a notification
using Telegram when these devices connect or disconnect.

## üöÄ Usage

1. [Create a Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot) and save its token.
1. Install using a package manager:
   * **Arch Linux**: [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/houserat/), e.g. `yay -S houserat`
   * **Cargo**: `cargo install houserat` (note that you'll have to manually install the service and
     config files)
1. Edit configuration at `/etc/houserat/config.toml` with bot token, device and user information
   ([example](config.example.toml)).
1. Enable and start service: `systemctl enable --now houserat`.

### ü§ñ Bot Configuration

Once you have your bot token you'll need to get chat IDs for every user that subscribes to
notifications. The easiest way to do that is:

1. Have the user start a conversation with the bot or send any message to it.
1. Open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getUpdates` in a browser (replacing `<token>` with your
bot token) and look for the chat ID, it should be in `message.chat.id` in the `result` array.
1. Put the chat ID you found in the `chat_id` field for that user in `config.toml`.
1. Optionally clearing the updates list by going back to the Telegram `getUpdates` API method and
   adding `?offset=<update_id+1>`, where the `update_id` is found in the result.  This would make it
   easier to find other chat IDs when repeating this process.

## üí´ How It Works

*Houserat* detects devices connecting to the network when they send a DHCP request packet. It will
then notify that device's subscriber and start polling this device to detect when it goes
away. Since phones don't always respond to PING packets houserat uses ARP requests which all devices
must respond to.

When several ARP requests go unanswered the device is considered disconnected and a notification is
sent to the subscriber.

## üí§ Anti-Spam

Houserat has several features designed to reduce notification spam:
* Configurable *cooldown* during which no new notifications are sent, for example if a device
  reconnects soon after its initial connection only 1 notification is sent.
* Configurable *quiet period* during which messages are sent without sound notifications. This can be
  used to avoid having noisy Telegram notifications at night.
